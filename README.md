# RELAP5 Input File Generator (RIFGen)
Nuclear Reactor safety analysis is a systematic study to demonstrate the limits and reliability of reactor in normal as well as accidental conditions. Reactor Excursion and Leak Analysis Program (RELAP) or RELAP5 is a tool for analyzing small-break LOCAs and system transients in PWRs or BWRs. It has the capability to model thermal-hydraulic phenomena in 1-D volumes. It is used for the thermal- hydraulic transient analysis in water-cooled nuclear reactors by solving one dimensional, two-phase thermal-hydraulic equations in an arbitrarily connected system of volumes. However, the preparation of the input file and subsequent analysis of results in this code is a tiresome task.

The aim of this work was to develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for preparation of the input file for RELAP5. The GUI has been developed in VB.NET using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.

This project deals with the development of the GUI Environment named as RELAP5 Input File Generator (RIFGen). This GUI generates complete set of cards for Hydrodynamic Components, Core Components, Time Step Control, Minor Edit Requests, Trip Input Data, Heat Structure Input, General Table Data, Plot Request data, Control System Data, Additional Plot variables, General Code Input, Couple Control Cards and other Miscellaneous Cards. These components have been tested and validated individually. RIFGen has been validated as a whole by generating input files for several standard problems.
